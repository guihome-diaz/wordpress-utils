# Wordpress-utils

This is a personal project to manage wordpress website. 

Objectives:
* **Export / import** content using `wp-cli` WXR format
* Export blog content into a custom format (pivot) for integration on other platforms
* Render text content and pictures in a text/PDF format


This project is in 2 parts:
* PHP and SHELL SCRIPTS to be executed on the server to extract / import data. I rely on the [wp cli][https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/] 
* Java part to parse and generate WP-CLI XML data export
