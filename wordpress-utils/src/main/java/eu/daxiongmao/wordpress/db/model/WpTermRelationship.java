/**
 * <p>Wordpress core table: TERM_RELATIONSHIPS.<br>
 * Posts are associated with categories and tags from the wp_terms table and this association is maintained in the wp_term_relationships table.
 * The association of links to their respective categories are also kept in this table.</p>
 * <p>Finally, once a term is assigned to an object like a post, the <code>wp_term_relationships</code> table is used to record it.</p>
 * <p>technically: this is a join table</p>
